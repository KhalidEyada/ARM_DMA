STM32F401 Digital Asset Management (DAM) Driver
Overview
The STM32F401 Digital Asset Management (DAM) Driver is a library that facilitates efficient management and control of digital assets, such as images, videos, audio files, documents, and other media, on STM32F401 microcontrollers. It enables developers to organize, store, retrieve, and process digital assets with optimal memory usage and performance.

Key Features
Asset Storage: The DAM driver provides functionalities to store digital assets in the microcontroller's memory, including internal flash or external memory devices.

Asset Retrieval: Easily retrieve and access digital assets from storage for further processing or display on connected peripherals.

Memory Optimization: The driver is designed to optimize memory usage, allowing efficient storage of assets even in resource-constrained environments.

Asset Metadata: Store and manage metadata associated with digital assets, such as timestamps, file formats, and descriptions.

Asset Compression/Decompression: Optionally, the DAM driver may support asset compression and decompression techniques to reduce storage requirements.

Sample Applications: Well-documented sample applications demonstrate various use cases for digital asset management, including multimedia playback and data visualization.

Installation
To integrate the STM32F401 DAM Driver into your STM32F401 project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Copy the relevant driver files (dam.c and dam.h) into your project directory.
Include the dam.h header file in your application code.
Usage
Using the STM32F401 DAM Driver involves the following steps:

Initialize the DAM: Call the initialization function to set up the digital asset management system, configure storage options, and allocate memory resources.

Store Assets: Use the provided functions to store digital assets in the designated memory space, and store associated metadata if required.

Retrieve Assets: Retrieve digital assets from storage for processing or display.

Optional Compression/Decompression: If supported, use the DAM driver's compression and decompression functions to manage asset size and optimize storage.
